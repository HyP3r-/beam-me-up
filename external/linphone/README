Building 'liblinphone' for lightweight applications under Debian Jessie
=======================================================================

'liblinphone' <www.linphone.org> is an exhaustive open source library
for SIP-based audio and video telephony. Unfortunately, it directly
and indirectly depends on a large number of other libraries making it
difficult to compile on a dedicated system.

This mini-howto is meant to help you generate an archivable source code
snapshot of 'liblinphone' (including the 'linphone' frontends) together
with the sub-libraries 'belle-sip', 'oRTP', and 'mediastreamer2'.

The libraries are configured for static linking and with reduced
functionality to support lightweight self-contained applications. The
original (but not only) purpose was to develop a video communication
tool for small embedded ARM-based devices running under Debian Linux
(Jessie).

Most of the instructions in detail can be found in the attached
'Makefile', which is both human-readable and machine-readable.


1. Prerequisites
----------------

This directory must contain:

  README     # This file
  Makefile

  bellesip-<version>.tar.gz
  linphone-<version>.tar.gz
  mediastreamer-<version>.tar.gz
  ortp-<version>.tar.gz

The .tar.gz files are not necessary if you intend to clone the original
source code. With the tarballs, no additional download from linphone.org
is necessary.

Under Debian Jessie, the following command installs the required
packages to satisfy build dependencies. It may be incomplete, however,
all required development packages are available under Debian Jessie,
tested with architectures 'armhf' and 'i386'.

  aptitude install libtool intltool libgtk2.0-dev libspeexdsp-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libx11-dev libxv-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libv4l-dev libxml2-dev libreadline-dev libsrtp-dev git \
    antlr antlr3 libantlr3c-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libsoup2.4-dev libpolarssl-dev
    # Line 1: linphone (from README)
    # Line 2: belle-sip    
    # Line 3: liblinphone / mediastreamer2


2. Building from source tarballs
--------------------------------

  # Check 'Makefile' for settings (i.e. installation path)
  make unpack
  make
  [sudo] make install


3. Downloading & building without source tarballs
-------------------------------------------------

  # Check 'Makefile' for settings (i.e. installation path)
  make clone
  make checkout
  make
  [sudo] make install


4. Creating a set of tarballs
-----------------------------

  make clone
  make pack
  [make clone-clean]   # to remove the cloned directory again
