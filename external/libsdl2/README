===============

On an Allwinner A20 SoCs, libSDL2 can make utilize the Mali 400 GPU
using OpenGL ES 2.0. However, OpenGL ES 2 appears not to work with
of both OpenGL and OpenCL ES 2 support are compiled in at the same time.
In the Debian Jessie, this is the case.

The attached package is based on the source package 'libsdl2 (2.0.2+dfsg1-6)'
and disables OpenGL support.
