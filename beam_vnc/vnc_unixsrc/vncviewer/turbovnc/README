To build with TurboVNC support:

	http://www.virtualgl.org/About/TurboVNC

first download and unpack/install the TurboJPEG package:

	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

Then build via something like this:

	make CCOPTIONS=-DTURBOVNC EXTRA_LIBRARIES='-L/home/runge/turbojpeg -Xlinker --rpath=/home/runge/turbojpeg -lturbojpeg'

where you replace /home/runge/turbojpeg with the directory containing
libturbojpeg.so you unpacked/installed.

You don't need the --rpath if you installed libturbojpeg.so to a standard
location (e.g. /usr/lib) or you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point the the
correct directory at runtime.

That command would be used with the ssvnc source tarball.  To use the
build.unix script do:

	env TURBOVNC="$EXTRA_LIBRARIES" ./build.unix

where EXTRA_LIBRARIES is as above.

The source files in this directory are from the VirtualGL TurboVNC
code base.

Note that the binary created will only support TurboVNC's tight vnc
implementation, and not the default TightVNC one.

Note that the x11vnc server also supports TurboVNC:

The current TurboVNC support is experimental.  Please report any bugs.
